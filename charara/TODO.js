/*  TODO

Responsive design: 
    -make top rank chara boxes smaller for <480 
    -set justify items of <768 to space-between
    -page title overflows, fix it

HTML2Canvas fixes:
    -textarea does not work. remove, change back to input
        -then adjust height between chara items.
    -instead of opening new tab, show on a mini popup, with a button to download (possibly share buttons in the future as well)
        -download button gives choice to download to specific folder

-drag image files to imgBar to upload them

-right click to return image to imgBar
-switch name input when dragging and dropping an image that is already on a chara container

TITLE ABILITY
    -give a space on top of the rows where the Podium logo and trademark (?) that will show on final image
    -Underneath, a label with the title of the ranker

PROMISES
    -switch stuff to promises.then
